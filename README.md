## Introduction

Welcome to the Gugal project! Gugal is a Google clone developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This web application allows users to perform searches just like they would on Google. When you enter a search query, Gugal fetches search results from Google's API and displays them in a user-friendly manner.

This project showcases the use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and API integration. It's a powerful tool for understanding how to work with external APIs and parse JSON data to display search results.
